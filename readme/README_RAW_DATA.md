# Global City Growth - Raw Data Archive

This repository contains the raw datasets used in [PAPER LINK HERE]. We include **only datasets whose licenses allow redistribution**. For datasets that do not allow redistribution, we provide scripts to download the data from the original sources using APIs (see the [Github](https://github.com/andreamusso96/global-city-growth) or Zenodo repository for our code [ZENODO CODE LINK HERE]).

## Overview

We study city growth in:

- United States: 1850–2020

- Global: 1975–2025

Data sources include satellite-derived rasters and micro-level censuses. 
This README references the primary works describing each dataset rather than explaining them in detail.
