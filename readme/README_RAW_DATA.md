# Large cities lose their growth advantage as urban systems mature -- Raw data

This repository contains the raw datasets used in [Large cities lose their growth advantage as urban systems mature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12417). We include **only datasets whose licenses allow redistribution**. For datasets that do not allow redistribution, we provide scripts to download the data from the original sources using APIs (see the [GitHub](https://github.com/andreamusso96/global-city-growth) or [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17339403)).

## Overview

We study city growth in:

- United States: 1850–2020

- Global: 1975–2025

Data sources include satellite-derived rasters and micro-level censuses. 
This README references the primary works describing each dataset rather than explaining them in detail.
