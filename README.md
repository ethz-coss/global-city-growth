# Large cities lose their growth advantage as urban systems mature

_A harmonized view of how cities grew in the United States (1850–2020) and worldwide (1975–2025), with reproducible code and shareable data._

## Paper abstract

The share of the world population living in cities with more than one million people rose from 11\% in 1975 to 24\% in 2025 (our estimates). Will this trend towards greater concentration in large cities continue or level off? We introduce two new city population datasets that use consistent city definitions across countries and over time. The first covers the world between 1975 and 2025, using satellite imagery. The second covers the U.S. between 1850 and 2020, using census microdata. We find that urban growth follows a characteristic life cycle. Early in urbanization, large cities grow faster than smaller ones. As urban systems mature, growth rates equalize across sizes. We use this life cycle to project future population concentration in large cities. Our projections suggest that 38\% of the world population will be living in cities with more than one million people by 2100. This estimate is higher than the 33\% implied by the well-known theory of proportional growth but lower than the 42\% obtained by extrapolating current trends.

## What’s in this project

Harmonized **boundaries** and **populations**, comparable across **time** and **countries** for:
  - **World:** 1975–2025  
  - **United States:** 1850–2020  

You can find the data [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17315338)

**Reproducible pipeline**
  - End‑to‑end DAG (100+ tasks) over ≈**300 GB** of raster, vector, CSV, and Parquet.
  - Outputs **200+ tables** to **PostgreSQL** (primary store) and **DuckDB** (analytics).
  - Containerized with **Docker**; orchestrated with **Dagster**.
  - Reference run (Apple M2, 32 GB RAM): **~5 hours** for the full build.

## Quick start (replication)

### 0) Prerequisites
- **Docker:** https://www.docker.com/  
- **Git:** https://git-scm.com/  
- **IPUMS API key:** https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/get-started/

### 1) Get the code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreamusso96/global-city-growth.git
```
### 2) Enter the folder
```
cd global-city-growth
```

### 3) Configure environment
```
cp .env.example .env
```
Open `.env` and set the IPUMS_API_KEY=your_key_here. This is necessary to download IPUMS data (get your key [here](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/get-started/))


### 4) Launch docker
```
docker compose up --build
```
First build usually takes ~3 minutes. 
This will create two docker container global-city-growth-database and global-city-growth-orchestrator. 
The first hosts a postgres database, the second hosts the code and is used to orchestrate the pipeline using Dagster. 

### 5) Orchestrate with Dagster

- Open Dagster UI: http://localhost:3000/
- Open the `Jobs` window in the top navigation bar 
- Run `0_all_job` to execute the full pipeline. The other jobs run subsets of the pipeline in case something breaks or you want to iterate
- You can monitor runs and asset materializations in the Dagster UI. [Quick guide](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/operate/webserver)

### 6) Outputs

- DuckDB and PostgreSQL are populated as configured in `.env`
- Tables and Figures are outputted in the same directory in the figures/ folder
- Inspect outputs with your favorite SQL tool or DuckDB CLI.
- Remember inputs are ≈300 GB; ensure ample free disk space for intermediates and outputs.
